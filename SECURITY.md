# Security Considerations

## Current Security Status

This MERN ecommerce application implements basic security practices suitable for development and learning purposes. Before deploying to production, please address the following:

### Implemented Security Features

✅ **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage
✅ **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for protected routes
✅ **Protected Routes**: Middleware to verify authentication before accessing sensitive endpoints
✅ **Admin Authorization**: Separate middleware for admin-only operations
✅ **Input Validation**: Mongoose schema validation for data integrity
✅ **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled for API access
✅ **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in .env files

### Recommended Production Enhancements

⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: All API endpoints currently lack rate limiting. This could make the application vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. 

**Recommendation**: Add rate limiting middleware using packages like `express-rate-limit`:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

⚠️ **Input Sanitization**: While Mongoose provides some protection, consider adding explicit input sanitization using packages like `express-mongo-sanitize` to prevent NoSQL injection.

⚠️ **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.

⚠️ **Security Headers**: Add security headers using packages like `helmet`:

```javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());
```

⚠️ **JWT Secret**: Change the JWT_SECRET to a strong, random value in production. Never commit secrets to version control.

⚠️ **Database URI**: Use MongoDB Atlas or a secure database instance with authentication enabled.

⚠️ **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

### False Positives

The CodeQL scanner may report SQL injection warnings for the User email lookups. These are false positives because:
- The application uses MongoDB (NoSQL), not SQL databases
- Mongoose automatically sanitizes query parameters
- Email inputs are validated by Mongoose schema validators

### Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Add rate limiting to all routes
- [ ] Install and configure helmet for security headers
- [ ] Install express-mongo-sanitize for NoSQL injection protection
- [ ] Use strong, unique JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins (not '*')
- [ ] Enable MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (don't expose stack traces)
- [ ] Add input validation middleware (express-validator is included)
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for stateful operations
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Conduct security audit and penetration testing

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email the maintainer directly rather than using the public issue tracker.
